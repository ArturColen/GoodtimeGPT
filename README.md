# ChatGPT clone
In order to learn more about web development with JavaScript/TypeScript, I developed a physical, working copy of ChatGPT in a [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/) class. 

## 🔨 Project functionality
Through data received from the OpenAI API, the program seeks to answer "all" your questions with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) quickly and intuitively.
