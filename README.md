In order to learn more about web development with JavaScript/TypeScript, I developed a physical, working copy of ChatGPT in a [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/) class.

## üî® Project functionality
Through data received from the OpenAI API, the program seeks to answer "all" your questions with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) quickly and intuitively.

## üíª Technologies used
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript): base programming language of the project
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/pt/docs/): programming language developed to add advanced features to JavaScript, such as static typing and interfaces
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/docs): allows the execution of JavaScript code outside the browser
* [React](https://pt-br.react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev): create user interfaces on web pages
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs): provides a number of additional features to React to facilitate the development of web applications
* [Tailwind CSS](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs): CSS framework used to style pages in a faster and more practical way
* [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction): integrate the artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI into the project

## üìÅ Project access
You can view the hosted page by clicking [here](https://goodtimegpt.vercel.app/).

**Observation:** if you are not receiving chat replies, you may need to manually configure your OpenAI API key. To do this, clone [this project's repository](https://github.com/ArturColen/GoodtimeGPT.git), create an `.env` file and set your API key in the field provided in the file (see the .env.example).
